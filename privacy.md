# Privacy Policy

The Gaeilgeoir extension has access to the following information:

- **the page content of every site you visit**: this is needed in order to be able to translate the web page. While it does keep a track of untranslated text, this information is only stored locally in your own browser and never shared with the developers of the extension. This data is only stored until you visit another page, close your tab / window or refresh your page.
- **your web history**: the extension needs to know the domain name of the website you are visting (e.g. 'Google.com'), in order to dynamically load the suitable translations for the website. It also stores whether the extension should be enabled / disabled for each website, and syncs this data across different computers when you log in using Chrome. This uses Chrome APIs for storage, so this information is never shared with the developers of the Gaeilgeoir extension.

Although the Gaeilgeoir extension accesses page content and your web history, this is only used for powering the features of the extension. None of your information is visible to the developer's of the extension. No user data is stored on the developer's side, without exception.
