        # Privacy Policy
        
        Thank you for using the Gaeilgeoir extension. This privacy policy outlines the information accessed by the extension and how it is handled.
        
        ### Information Collected:
        
        #### 1. Page Content:
        
        The Gaeilgeoir extension requires access to the page content of the websites you visit to provide translation services. Untranslated text is temporarily stored locally in your browser and is never shared with the extension developers. This data is retained only until you navigate to another page, close your tab/window, or refresh the page.
        
        #### 2. Web History:
        
        To dynamically load suitable translations for each website, the extension needs to know the domain name (e.g., 'Google.com') of the site you are visiting. It also stores your preference for enabling/disabling the extension on specific websites. This information is synchronized across different computers when you log in to your browser (Chrome/Firefox) and is managed directly by the browser using its storage APIs. It is not shared with the Gaeilgeoir extension developers.
        
        ### Data Usage:
        
        - The Gaeilgeoir extension processes page contents and web history solely to power its features. None of this information is visible to the extension developers. No user data is stored on the developers' side under any circumstances.
        
        ### Your Privacy Matters:
        
        - We are committed to protecting your privacy, and the information accessed by the Gaeilgeoir extension is used exclusively for enhancing your browsing experience.
        
        ### Updates to Privacy Policy:
        
        - We may update this privacy policy as the Gaeilgeoir extension evolves. Please check this page periodically for any changes.
