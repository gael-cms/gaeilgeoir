# Privacy Policy

The Gaeilgeoir extension has access to the following information:

- **the page content of every site you visit**: this is needed in order to be able to translate the web page. While it does keep a track of untranslated text, this information is only stored locally in your own browser and never shared with the developers of the extension. This data is only stored until you visit another page, close your tab / window or refresh your page.
- **your web history**: the extension needs to know the domain name of the website you are visiting (e.g. 'Google.com'), in order to dynamically load the suitable translations for the website. It also stores whether the extension should be enabled / disabled for each website, and syncs this data across different computers when you log in to your browser (Chrome / Firefox). This uses browser APIs for storage, so this information is never shared with the developers of the Gaeilgeoir extension, but managed directly by the browser.

Although the Gaeilgeoir extension processes your page contents and web history, this is only used for powering the features of the extension. None of your information is visible to the developers of the extension. No user data is stored on the developers side, without exception.
